### Join the Discussion Group ###

The best way to help this project is to join the discussion group.  You can join the discussion group by following the link to "General discussion..." on the left side of this page, under "Groups."  Once you're on the group's page, click "Apply for group membership" on the right and follow the instructions (you might get asked to sign in to your Google Account first, that's normal).
