# Joining the Trinity Mobile Project #

There are a lot of ways to become involved with the Trinity Mobile project, whether you're a developer, a member of the Trinity community, or just someone who's interested in the project.

To officially join the Trinity Mobile project so you can edit the wiki, submit bugs or feature requests, or to do stuff with code you'll need a free Google Account.  You don't need a Gmail e-mail address to get a Google Account.  Once you have a Google Account, e-mail rob@trinityeaston.org with your Google Account username or email address and request to become a member of the project.

Once you're a member of this project, you can help in a variety of ways.  Here are some examples to help you get started.

## If You're Not a JavaScript/HTML/CSS Developer ##

Not really a developer?  Or maybe you're a fantastic developer who uses one or several other programming languages who has no time/interest/etc to learn JavaScript/HTML/CSS?  Not a problem.  You can still be involved with this project by downloading the app and testing it like crazy, submitting issues you've found when using the app, making suggestions for future versions, or creating documentation about how to use the app.  You can also help out by telling people about the app.  After all, there's not much point to designing and improving an app if no one's using it.

Sometimes developers of apps have a hard time explaining how the app works to users, so documentation for users by users can be pretty helpful.  The easiest way to start with writing documentation is with this wiki.  If you'd like to edit this wiki, you'll need to join this project.  To do that, you'll need to sign up for a free Google Account (you don't need a Gmail e-mail address to get a Google Account).

## If you're a JavaScript/HTML/CSS Developer ##

If you're a developer who knows a bit of JavaScript, HTML, and/or CSS, we could use your help.  You don't have to know all of those things.  If you know JavaScript, you can look through the code, see how the comments and the formatting is done (4-space indent), check for bugs, and make improvements.  Similarly, if you know HTML and CSS - even if you don't know JavaScript - please look through the HTML files and CSS stylesheets and make fixes or improvements.  You can even use jQuery Mobile's Theme Roller to make more themes for Trinity Mobile.  Of course you can always submit issues you've found using the app, whether the issue is in the code or is simply something in the app that doesn't work.

The project also needs iPhone/iPad, Windows Phone, and Blackberry developers.  The code as it is should be able to run on all of those platforms, but right now there's just an Android version.
